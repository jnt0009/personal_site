# Data And Dining
<!-- ![](../assets/primary.png) -->
## Introduction
Working both with and on a data team is an experience that is often easier to communicate in a giant metaphor rather than talk about all of the metrics and pipelines and services. While it is important understand what is going on with the data behind the scenes and the technology under the hood. The point of language is to get a message across. So here is Data and Dining a metaphor about being both a data provider and consumer. The examples given below are not exhaustive but hopefully get the conversation started.
## Overview
These eco-systems need two(2) things to thrive. The People who are usually on the service side or the consumer side but vendors exist in both spaces as well. The food which in it's raw form is the data which comes in as many forms as a meal does. The cooked version of this is the meal and these are the types of tasks your "kitchen" can churn out. Below are few more examples of People and Meals you can encounter. This list is not exhaustive but hopefully gets the ultimate point across that. The quality of analysis or a meal is a sum of its component parts. The Person's ability to do the job. The amount of time given to "cook" and the desired outcome or dish.
## People
Think of each data team member as a chef. Just like most teams each chef has a specialty. You wouldn’t want your pastry chef on fish. They probably could cook a decent meal but it may not be their best and it probably won’t be as efficient.
- Customers - These are your stakeholders. They keep the lights on at the place. It’s important to make sure you’re catering your menu to the clientele.
- Executive Chef - This is person makes the strategic business decisions, creating the menu/concept of the restaurant. The parallel here is your highest ranking engineer, usually C-suite or Director level. They are usually not involved in the day to day but the overall shape/direction of the team.
- Chef de Cuisine (CDC) - The CDC is the manager of the kitchen. They also collaborate with the restaurant’s general manager. They are involved in day-to-day kitchen operations. This is usually a director level person or maybe a senior manager. Someone that leads the team at a higher level day to day.
- Sous Chef de Cuisine - Sous means “under” in French. This is the chef de cuisine‘s deputy. The sous chef helps oversee the line cooks and steps in for the chef de cuisine when needed.This is likely a Senior Manager or sometimes a highly regarded individual contributor. Someone that handles the day to day of the team.
This is where I break from my French Brigade System and just talk about kitchens generally.  
- Specialty Chefs - There are a variety of different chef specialties out there. A Patissier making who specializes in pastry or a Saucier who specializes in making sauces 
- Line cook - These are the 
- Butchers - Data Engineers
- Prep Cook - the are your data/analytics engineers that lay the ground work for data to flow to different stations
## Meals
- Hibachi - The idea of hibachi is that you and maybe a few of your friends (stakeholders) gather around the chef (data person) as he cooks the food.
- Buffet - The idea of a buffet is that the chefs (data team) prepares a set number of items (dashboards) and   
- Made to order - These are usually fixed menus that allow for a little customization from the customer requesting it. Most of the ingredients are already pre prepared from the buffet service but now you can customize them.
- This differs from hibachi because you usually put in a ticket for  MTO and it is brought out to you.
- Course meals - Longer projects 
- Tasting menus - exploratory short projects
- Groceries to go - you get data (groceries from the restaurant) to then take home and assemble the meal yourself.
## Summary
So remember as a stakeholder it is important to consider your data teams type just as you would consider a restaurants type. If your data team is shaped like a McDonalds and meant for speed and efficiency and overall simplicity then keep that in mind when requesting large and elaborate analysis because just like the McDonalds it’s going to have to do its best to cobble together its best effort. That goes doubly so if you are doing it on the spot. Conversely if your data team is shaped like a Michelin Starred establishment then keep in mind if you were to order a Filet-o-fish at such a place it’s going to take forever to come out, be extremely over complicated and only taste marginally better than the fast food version. Most meals can be made in most kitchens given enough time and communication. The same is true for most data teams.
